RM3 (RockPi CM3) build - 2nd pass - 072723

Failed at "[bootstrap : apt update before kernel downloads]"
(DOWNGRADED:", "  dvb-tools ir-keytable libdvbv5-0 libdvbv5-doc libv4l-0 libv4l-dev", "  libv4l2rds0 libv4lconvert0 openbox qv4l2 v4l-utils")

  Same as before... checked and the apt package is at ver 2.2.4 (ARM64)
  will add the allow downgrade... and then check later for apt version

  Note: "ansible --version" shows [core 2.12.4]

  Try running again without changing ansible... perhaps the fix is "ignore_error"
    NOPE... still fails... like it determined the rigtht thing was to downgrade, but
    without the directive it did not finalize the changes...


We had a communication loss at:
   [enhanced-content : Install cron package required by phonehome.python]
Probably not coincidence...

The target is still running... ip still 10.0.0.59
Do a restart of the build and see what happens...
(BTW... apt is still version 2.2.4)

We get the fail again at "[bootstrap : apt update before kernel downloads]" for unknown option!!

And a fail at the cron install...
Perhaps a pre-build load of cron? (and pull the install step)
The cron install completed with:
- name: Install cron package required by phonehome.python
  apt:
    name: cron
    state: present 
#  become: true  
(note the commented become: true... which may have made it work... but I also changed the form of the ansible from "command: apt install cron" so that may have been the fix... ??)

Build went to completion except for the "ignore error" problems and the cron problem... We will see how the image works tomorrow...
