Radxa CM3 USB

USB hub isn't working with RM3 on CM4 hat 1.8.5 (after making changes for boot)

Scoped signals and find:
- Osc never runs
- reset line goes high at boot but is never pulled down 
   (so the hub isn't being initialized)
- Looks like a software issue??
- look on net and find some help at: 
  - https://forum.microchip.com/s/topic/a5C3l000000MbcjEAC/t374685
    describes troubleshooting when we don't have power pin enabled

  - https://forum.radxa.com/t/cm3-cm4-io-base-b-waveshare/10291/4
    describes hardware issues with CM3 and USB (and possible solution)

  So I have tried:
  - Solder pin 101 to gnd (no help)
  - Add to boot/config.txt:  dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=host  (no help) 
  - echo host > /sys/devices/platform/fe8a0000.usb2-phy/otg_mode 
    (was "otg")   (no help) (got changed back to otg) 

  - run: cd /lib/systemd/system
  - run: wget openhdfpv.org/wp-content/BaseImages/usb.service 
  - run: chmod +x usb.service 
  - run: systemctl enable usb    
  - (no joy ... but we now show "host" in the otg_mode file)

  (Still no nRST signal to hub... symptom of USB not enabled)

  - mount uSD on RPi-4
  - cd /media/pi/rootfs/boot
  - sudo touch config.txt
  - sudo vi config.txt
    - add "dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=host" and save
  - unmount uSD and try again in target  (no joy)

  - run: lsblk
  - run: mkdir jim
  - run: mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 jim
  - run: cd jim
  - run: ls 		(we find an empty config.txt file there)
  - run: vi config.txt
    - add "dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=host" and save
  - run: reboot now
  - (no joy)

- Tried the RM3_20230827 code in the 1.7.2  board set. No USB
- Burned fresh copy of RM3_20230809 code and tried in 1.7.2 board set... USB works
- (Both are debian bullseye... not sure of the date of the source though)
- Try this code image in the 1.8.5 hardware... no USB
- Put 0809 image back into 1.7.2 hardware... still works
- 0827 in 1.7.2 hardware ... works
- 0824 in 1.7.2 hardware ... works

Is there any other difference between the 1.7.2 hdwr and the 1.8.5 hardware except the "Bi" vs "B" versions of the USB2514??
