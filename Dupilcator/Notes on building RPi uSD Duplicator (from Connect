Notes on building RPi uSD Duplicator (from Connectbox.technology.com)

- Open Rpi website (https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) and download RPi OS with desktop (bookworm: July 4, 2024)
- Using BalenaEtcher, burn image to 8GB uSD ("target" uSD)
- When burn to target uSD is complete, insert target uSD into RPi 3 unit and boot the RPI 3
- Connect mouse and keyboard 
- Go through standard RPi setup
   - Set country, language, timezone
   - Create username and password (jim, jim)
   - Setup screen
   - Choose wifi
   - Enter wifi password
   - Choose browser (Chromium)
   - Select RPi Connect preference (disable)
   - Select update software preference (skip)
   - Restart
- After reboot open a terminal window (top row of screen, rightmost icon... looks like small black screen with ">") 
- At the top of terminal window, select Edit -> Preferences and choose "Custom" from the pallet list... then select a text color you like (light green)
- In terminal window, type the following commands, waiting for completion after each command...
   - wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GeoDirk/osid-python3/master/install_osid.sh  
   - chmod 755 install_osid.sh
   - sudo ./install_osid.sh
      - (Note that this takes a while to run... be patient... mine took about 15 minutes)
      -   jim note: "setting up firefox" spotted during this install
   - When install is complete, you will see a message, "===Restart Your System===" above the command prompt
   - sudo reboot now
- After reboot, no icon...
- Problem is that script expected the user name to be "pi" not "jim" so the desktop setup for the icon fails
- The folder /etc/osid/system has the icon and the run_app.sh script
- Open files icon (top of RPi desktop)
  - browse to /etc/osid/system
  - right click the icon named "rPi SD Card Duplicator" and choose "copy"
  - browse to /home/jim/Desktop
  - paste icon into /home/jim/Desktop folder
  - in terminal window
    - cd /home/jim/Desktop      
    - chmod 755 osid.desktop.sample


    Perhaps the best choice is now to rebuild using pi/pi as username/password; also, select firefox as the browser...
