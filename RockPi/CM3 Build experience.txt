CM3 Build experience

Starting with image: radxa-cm3-io-debian-bullseye-xfce4-arm64-20230201-1123-gpt.img.xz
Hardware: CM3 on modified CM4 HAT (ver 1.7.2) (pin 76 to gnd via 20K; uSD power control inverted)
Ansible code of 072023

Note: ansible packages build order:
 - bootstrap, hat-service, dns-dhcp, network-interfaces, wifi-ap, mikegleasonjr, enhanced-content, nginx, captive-portal, webserver-content, usb-content, sample-content, rpi-permissions, wlan-set, remove-lz4

Initial findings on ansible script:
  - Codename: bullseye
  - Family: debian
  - ansible_kernel: 4.19.193-67-rockchip-g450948183988
  - machine type: Radxa CM3 IO
  - CM4 present=false; MTypeRadxa CM3 IO\\x00; NEO_present=false; OZ2_present=false; PIi_present=false
  - working on base of: ['Radxa CM3 IO\\x00']|first

Errors:
- [bootstrap : apt update before kernel downloads]   (tasks/main.yml #246)
  - Code tried to downgrade some modules and failed
  - suggested add "allow_downgrade: yes"
  - added and restarted build... got through but a later restart of the build (for another failure) gave an error "allow_downgrade is unrecognized option"
  - removed the "allow_downgrade:yes" line and restarted... this time it ran through 
  - perhaps the code downgraded the apt module to where the option was invalid??

- [mikegleasonjr.firewall : Load v4 rules]      (tasks/rules.yml #7)
  - several invalid parameter errors when running script /etc/iptables.v4.generated
  - determined iptables commands all crashed for "invalid parameter"
  - net search found advice:  
        update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy
  - ran the command by hand and restarted
  - fixed

-[enhanced-content : Run npm to install dependencies for connectbox-manage] (tasks/main.yml  #123)
  - "cmd": "/usr/bin/npm install", "msg": "npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine
  - error indicates we are at ver 3.4.0 but need to be at ver 7
  - tried manual /usr/bin/npm install" and got "up to date"
  - tried "npm" and found "npm@7.5.2"
  - looks like it installed 7.5.2 (??)
  - why then the error?
  - restart build

- [enhanced-content : Cause phonehome.py to execute every 10 minutes via cron IF not a Moodle box  (We have different process for Moodle)] (tasks/main.yml  #160) 
  - failed to find crontab
  - need to install cron:  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install cron
  - manually installed and restarted the build



First Boot...
Power on... not a lot of joy... did boot... the desktop wouldn't recognized keystrokes and the serial also didn't respond...

Powered down... pulled chip... mounted /boot on my RPi4 desktop and did a "touch ssh"... put chip back in CM3 set and rebooted... 

Keyboard now recognized... could log on to desktop... no icons on desktop but mouse right click let me start a terminal... (previously tried ssh root@10.0.0.39 and got ssh refusal)... on the CM3 desktop (terminal) I did a "sudo systemctl start ssh" and got that to work... back on Mac, I was able to now do the ssh root@10.0.0.39...

-Checked /usr/local/connectbox (it does exist) for the progress file of PxUSBm... nada... so I'm guessing the PxUSBm service didn't start... 

- ran "systemctl status PxUSBm" and it is showing failure (with restarts)... try stopping service (ok) 
- checking the neo-battery-shutdown... "systemctl start neo-battery-shutdown" then "journalctl --follow --unit=neo-battery-shutdown" showing that the neo-battery-shutdown code is failing when trying to import RPi.GPIO (actually that isn't much of a surprise)... the error is "RuntimeError: It is not NanoPi based board"...
- Tried a manual run of PxUSBm.py ("python3 PxUSBm.py" and it fails with error:
File "/usr/local/connectbox/bin/PxUSBm.py", line 364, in do_fdisk
  child = pexpect.spawn('fdisk /dev/mmcblk0', timeout = 10


PxUSBm.py #1125 - define new module for CM3 different from CM4

Need to do "apt install fdisk"
Need to re-install crda  ("apt-get install crda")
