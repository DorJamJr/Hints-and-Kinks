Notes on USB2514 - 100623

Still fighting RM3 on HAT 1.8.5 for USB hub issues

- Testing with CM4... usb bit speed is running 12MB/sec... so NOT 480Mb/sec
- RM3 and CM4 booting on same HAT... no changes... 10K pull down on reserved pin
  is in place... CM4 seemed to tolerate that...
- Not seeing wiggle on 2514 pins 30 & 31 (??) which is usb to RM3/CM4
- USB_OTG_ID not tied to gnd
- 2514 pin 8 (HD4_N) is low swinging high, pin 9 (HD4_P) is high swinging low
- 2514 pins 30/31 not swinging with 8&9
- RM3 doesn't like to boot with the HDMI monitor connected
- W/o HDMI... boot... pin 9 wiggling... we have VBus power (so I THINK the hub 
   is working) but w/o HDMI I can't see keystrokes... 
- Wiggle the hdmi connector are got it to boot... then we do see keystrokes...
- Keys... external oscillator, ground the OTG sense pin (pin 101)
