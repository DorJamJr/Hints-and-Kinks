Notes on building RPi uSD Duplicator (from Connectbox.technology.com)


- Open Rpi website (https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) and download RPi OS with desktop (bullseye: July 4, 2024)
- Using BalenaEtcher, burn image to 8 GB uSD ("target" uSD)
- When burn to target uSD is complete, insert target uSD into RPi 3 unit and boot the RPI 3
- Connect mouse and keyboard 
- Go through standard RPi setup
   - Set country, language, timezone
   - Create username and password (pi,pi)
   - Click "OK" on warning screen for pi/pi username
   - Setup screen
   - Choose wifi
   - Enter wifi password
   - Choose browser (Firefox)
   - Select RPi Connect preference (enable)
   - Select update software preference (skip)
   - Restart

- After reboot open a terminal window (top row of screen, rightmost icon... looks like small black screen with ">") 
- At the top of terminal window, select Edit -> Preferences and choose "xterm" from the pallet list
- In terminal window, type the following commands, waiting for completion after each command...
   - wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GeoDirk/osid-python3/master/install_osid.sh  
   - chmod 755 install_osid.sh
   - sudo ./install_osid.sh 
      - (Note that this takes a while to run... be patient... mine took about 30 minutes)
    - When install is complete, you will see a message, "===Restart Your System===" above the command prompt [6:05 pm]
   - sudo touch /var/osid/access.log
   - sudo chmod 666 /var/osid/access.log 
   - sudo vi /etc/hosts
   		- add "osid" to end of ::1 list  

- Now we will need to create a virtual environment, install cherrypy in that environment and edit the run_app.sh to use it.
 	- cd
 	- python3 -m venv duplicator	// create the venv
 	- source duplicator/bin/activate
 	- pip3 install cherrypy
 	- deactivate
	- sudo vi /etc/osid/system/run_app.sh
		- delete lines 2,3
		- insert in their place:
			source "/home/pi/duplicator/bin/activate"
			cd /etc/osid/system
			sudo /home/pi/duplicator/bin/python3 server.py
		- at the end append the following:
			deactivate

- sudo reboot now

This works. The icon now properly starts the rPi Duplicator program.


--- Making an image... first try (with Bookworm)... resulted in img size 6.9GB, xz size 2.1GB... too big for github
--- Making an image... second try (with Bullseye)... resulted in img size 5.5GB, xz size ??GB... 
- Make an image:
	- in terminal on RPi3:
		- shutdown now
	- Power down the RPi3
	- pull the uSD from the RPi3
	- put the uSD into USB carrier on RPi4
	- terminal on RPi4
		- lsblk
		- umount /dev/sda1
		- umount /dev/sda2
		- cd /home/pi/connectbox
		- sudo connectbox-tools/deployment/shrink-imag.sh /dev/sda Images/RPi_Duplicator.img
	- when image created, then do shrink
		xz -k Images/RPi_Duplicator.img
