Build RM3_20230809  (the second one... first was renamed to RM3_20230809-0)

This build based on first 20230809 build with mods to ansible to handle issues discovered

0:00 	power on 
0:07    RM3 green LED on
1:30 	reboot screen
2:55	second reboot
3:33	debian logon screen
4:58	systemctl PxUSBm  looks good
		systemctl neo-battery-shutdown  failed restart too quickly
		/etc/systemd/system/neo-battery-shutdown   does have the added line (but it didn't work)

		Try systemctl start neo-battery-shutdown
		that worked

		still missing urllib3    (so will crash neo-battery-shutdown when loading statistics page)

+++ add install of urllib3 later... perhaps in hat-service tasks?

+++ add to PxUSBm.py (near line 1475... before "while x==x")
       	process = os.popen('systemctl start neo-battery-shutdown')
       	process.close()


Made the changes... build again

0:00 	power on
0:07 	RM3 green LED on
1:30 	reboot screen
2:55 	second reboot
3:33	debian logon 

Looks like I didn't add the startup lines to PxUSBm.py   AARGH!
Added by hand and restarted the PxUSBm service and it is working fine
(Note... the urllib3 was installed with the new ansible...)


Build again

0:00 	power on
0:07 	RM3 green LED on
1:30 	reboot screen
2:52	second reboot
3:32 	debian login    but no OLED
5:08 	splash screen

YEAH!!

Kirk published a new PxUSBm.py.
Test on RM3 target by:
  stop PxUSBm service
  copy current PxUSBm.py to xPxUSBm.py
  push new usr_local_connectbox_bin_PxUSBm.py to /usr/local/connectbox/bin
  copy usr_local_connectbox_PxUSBm.py to PxUSBm.py
  run   python PxUSBm.py  and watch for issues
  If all ok...
  delete /usr/local/connectbox/expand_progress.txt
  power down
  power up and watch timings...

  Results:
  Stop PxUSBm and neo-battery-shutdown services
  0:00  	python PxUSBm.py
  0:07		splash screen
  all seems normal...

  do a reboot now   start clock at HDMI no signal screen
  0:00 		HDMI no signal
  1:24 		first reboot
  2:49		second reboot
  3:25		OLED  (Amber coincident)
  3:30  	debian login

  normal power down, power up
  0:00 		push PB1
  0:06 		I -> O screen
  0:22 		power is off

  0:00 		push PB1
  0:34		OLED / Amber

  The power off screen (I->O) is on until power removed, then is on again at power on... curious... no power on the OLED... so it isn't holding... the processor seems to be re-establishing that ..??  ... 
   -- power down, then remove/replace OLED, 
      then turn on... no I->O on booting... 
   -- power down ... wait 1 minute before power up... get I->O... 
   -- power down... quickly remove/replace OLED ... no I->O
   -- power down... measure OLED pins... clk=0.53, dat=0.53, Vdd=0.4
   -- doesn't seem to be decaying... (12:10 PM, 081023)
