Build From Local Repo
------------------------------

Using GitHub local repo for a build

GitHub Desktop allows us to easily see branches and to change our local repo to such a branch. If we cd into the local repo (like Documents/GitHub/connectbox-pi) and start our build process from there, we should be able to create a build using a branch of our repo.

So opening GitHub Desktop, choose repo connectbox-pi and then choose branch brandtxt-generated. (Note that this select is sticky... ie, looking at a different repo with GitHub Desktop leaves the connectbox-pi repo still in the selected branch... and thus, the text of code in the GitHub/conectbox-pi folders containing that which is associated with the selected branch.) (verified)

To build...
  - cd Documents/GitHub
  - chmod 777 connectbox-tools/deployment/make_cb.py
  -   (it was 644)
  - connectbox-tools/deployment/make_cb.py
 

 Build from merge of master into branch
 ---------------------------------------

 It may be desireable to test a build which would have resulted from merging a branch into master. We can do that (without actually doing the merge) by first creating a new branch from the previous branch and then merging master into the new branch, then building from that branch. 

 Example...
 In GitHub Desktop, select repo connectbox-pi, branch brandtxt_generated
 Create a new branch btg_w_master from brandtxt_generated
 Change to branch btg_w_master
 In the branch pulldown, select "Choose branch to merge to btg_w_master"
 In the next dialog, select master
 Click the button to merge and resolve conflicts
 Click the button to finish the merge.

 Now proceed to build (as above) using the branch btg_w_master
