  for this image, default user is "radxa" and password is "radxa"

  ifconfig not available; tried "apt install net-tools" and that failed (can't locate package net-tools)

  tried "sudo apt update" and then "apt install net-tools"... that worked

  (note: alternate command to "ifconfig" is "ip a" but how about iwconfig??)


OK... that image failed at the reboot, "failed to find power model mode" (and lots other fails)



Let's try the previous version...
radxa-cm3-io_debian_bullseye_cli_b20.img

- login/pw = radxa/radxa
- need to install net-tools
