Build RM3_20230809  (the second one... first was renamed to RM3_20230809-0)

This build based on first 20230809 build with mods to ansible to handle issues discovered

0:00 	power on 
0:07    RM3 green LED on
1:30 	reboot screen
2:55	second reboot
3:33	debian logon screen
4:58	systemctl PxUSBm  looks good
		systemctl neo-battery-shutdown  failed restart too quickly
		/etc/systemd/system/neo-battery-shutdown   does have the added line (but it didn't work)

		Try systemctl start neo-battery-shutdown
		that worked

		still missing urllib3    (so will crash neo-battery-shutdown when loading statistics page)

+++ add install of urllib3 later... perhaps in hat-service tasks?

+++ add to PxUSBm.py (near line 1475... before "while x==x")
       	process = os.popen('systemctl start neo-battery-shutdown')
       	process.close()
