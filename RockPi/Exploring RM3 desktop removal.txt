Exploring RM3 desktop removal

082523

The build image we used for the RM3_20230824.img was:
   radxa-cm3-io-debian-bullseye-xfce4-arm64-20230317-0810-gpt.img
the title of which seems to imply an xfce4 desktop...

The CB image resulting from the build has a desktop, but no applications along
 the side or an applications menu. A right click of the mouse on the desktop
 shows a pulldown with some applications... some work (ex, dictionary, Ristretto Image Viewer, Firefox, Task Manager, all system tools (xterm, uxterm, file manager), multimedia tools, utilities, settings)   

Trying to execute "obconf" we get an error "obconf... No such file or directory"
  and the dialog banner reads "Openbox"... 

So what is relationship between xfce4 and openbox??
 From what I can tell on the net, Openbox is a window manager used in place of the xfwm (xf window manager (?)) tool. It is installed on top of xfce4

Experiments...
- Start with a fresh copy of the base image (20230317) and boot to login; 
   this gives a debian desktop with menu bar at top and icons on left (Filesystem root; boot; File System; Home) 
     The pulldown menu from top has an About. Opening that gives an option"
      About, which revealt: "Xfce is a collwction of programs that together provice a full featured desktop environment" and then lists the programs that make up the core: xfwm4 (window manager); xfce4-panel (Panel); xfdesktop (Desktop manager); thunar (File manager); thunar-volman (Volume manager); xfce4-session (Session Manager); xfce4-settings (Setting System); xfce4-appfinder (Application Finder); xfconf (Settings Daemon); garcon (Menu Library); tumbler (Thumbnails Service);
- login (rock/rock) and create logon for root (connectbox)
- logout then log back in as root (and we get same desktop)
- which openbox -> /usr/bin/openbox
- ls /usr/share/xsessions shows lightdm-xsession.desktop, openbox.desktop and xfce.desktop...
- 

- Try removing openbox with apt-get remove openbox
("using /usr/bin/xfwm4 to provide /usr/bin/s-window-manager in auto mode")
- succeeds...  do "reboot now"... login as root... same desktop
- try " apt-get remove --auto-remove openbox " to remove support packages (pic taken)... succeeds... reboot... login as root... ok
- try "apt-get purge openbox "... reboot... login... OK
- 

Try removing Xfce4... 
- try "apt-get remove xfce4-* "  (34 packages removed)
- then "apt-get remove xfce4" (no packages to remove... 
   suggests "apt autoremove")
- then "apt autoremove"   (19 packages removed... 12.7 MB space)
- then "apt-get purge xfce4" ("xfce4 not installed so none removed")
- reboot... login root... we have desktop "debian" in blue (normal) but no terminal... try ctl/option F2... we get terminal with full screen...

- try "vi /etc/X11/default-display-manager" and comment out first line reading
   "/usr/sbin/lightdm"

- from https://www.baeldung.com/linux/boot-linux-command-line-mode
   - cat /proc/1/comm (shows "systemd") so we do:
      - systemctl set-default multi-user.target
      - reboot now
      YES!!

SO... I now have what looks like a CLI image for the RM3. Let's do a shring and 
 xz on THAT image and use it as a starting point for an RM3 build...

Save as:
   radxa-cm3-io-debian-bullseye-cli-arm64-20230317.img
   (size of .img was 3.3 GB; size of .xz was 525 MB)

A bit of exploring on the image...
  - to get size of directory use "du -sh <directoryName>"
  - desktop files are generally in /usr/share/applications (212K)
  - /usr/share/X11   (5.9M)
  - /usr/share       (497M)

  So there is some opportunity to remove more "desktop" related stuff, but this
   is a good start. Try a build.
