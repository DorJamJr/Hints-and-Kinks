Notes on building RPi uSD Duplicator (from Connectbox.technology.com)

Round 1 failed to put icon on screen due to username NOT being "pi". Turns out the script expects the /home/pi directory
 to exist and when not found, the icon is not placed on the desktop.
 This round we will make user "pi", password "pi", select the Firefox browser and enable RPi Connect. [2:53 pm]
Round 2 was successful, but the 8GB uSD was too small to allow for testing

- Open Rpi website (https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) and download RPi OS with desktop (bookworm: July 4, 2024)
- Using BalenaEtcher, burn image to 32GB uSD ("target" uSD)
- When burn to target uSD is complete, insert target uSD into RPi 3 unit and boot the RPI 3
- Connect mouse and keyboard 
- Go through standard RPi setup
   - Set country, language, timezone
   - Create username and password (pi,pi)
   - Setup screen
   - Choose wifi
   - Enter wifi password
   - Choose browser (Chromium)
   - Select RPi Connect preference (disable)
   - Select update software preference (skip)
   - Restart
- After reboot open a terminal window (top row of screen, rightmost icon... looks like small black screen with ">") 
- At the top of terminal window, select Edit -> Preferences and choose "Custom" from the pallet list... then select a text color you like (light green)
- In terminal window, type the following commands, waiting for completion after each command...
   - wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GeoDirk/osid-python3/master/install_osid.sh  
   - chmod 755 install_osid.sh
   - sudo ./install_osid.sh  [5:40 pm]
      - (Note that this takes a while to run... be patient... mine took about 30 minutes)
    - When install is complete, you will see a message, "===Restart Your System===" above the command prompt [6:05 pm]
   - sudo touch /var/osid/access.log
   - sudo chmod 666 /var/osid/access.log   
   - sudo reboot now

- Now we will need to create a virtual environment, install cherrypy in that environment and edit the run_app.sh to use it.
   So open the termnial and then
 	- cd
 	- python3 -m venv duplicator	// create the venv
 	- cd duplicator
 	- source bin/activate
 	- pip3 install cherrypy
	- cd /etc/osid/system
	- vi run_app.sh
		- delete lines 2,3
		- insert in their place:
			source "/home/pi/duplicator/bin/activate"
			cd /etc/osid/system
			sudo /home/pi/duplicator/bin/python3 server.py
		- at the end append the following:
			deactivate
				


--- old method and old notes ---

After reboot, open terminal and do...
   - sudo mv /usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED /usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED.old
   - pip3 install cherrypy
   - edit /etc/hosts to add "osid" at end of ::1 ...


After another reboot, cherrypy lib is available, but launching the duplicator doesn't get server.py started. 
 Manually starting the server with python3 server.py succeeds, and then launch duplicator works. ???
 Perhaps not enough delay?
 	- 3 tries of icon fails
 	- sudo chmod 755 /etc/osid/system/run_app.sh

Current state:
	- After reboot, icon start fails
	- then terminal 
		- cd /etc/osid/system
		- /usr/bin/python3 server.py    // and icon now works
		- Issue is that doing the script run_app.sh fails because it results in a python call that doesn't have lib cherrypy
		- Do reboot and then 
		  - cd /etc/osid/system
		  - ./run_app.sh 			// fail
		  - start venv
		  - ./drun_app.sh 			// fail
		  - need to find out how to start venv in the drun_app.sh shell...



 	- cd
 	- python3 -m venv duplicator
 	- cd duplicator
 	- source bin/activate
 	- pip3 install cherrypy
 	- deactivate 		// to leave venv
 	- ps -A				// list processes
 	- kill -9 <pid>






 --- old notes ---

- After reboot, we have two icons: Root File Manager and rPi SD Card Duplicator
- Double click rPi SD Card Duplicator and we are asked how what to do with it... choose "Execute"
   - error: "Site can't be reached"
   - caused by the /etc/osid/system/server.py failing to start
      - that caused by package cherrypy not being installed
         - that caused by python packages being "Externally managed"
         	- suggested work around:
         	sudo mv /usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED /usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED.old
         	pip3 install cherrypy
         	sudo touch /var/osid/access.log
         	sudo chmod 666 /var/osid/access.log
         	- This works ... now the icon properly launches the duplicator

- To use duplicator..
	- download an image (ends up in /home/pi/downloads)
	- launch the Root File Manager (icon just above the rPi SD Card Duplicator icon)
	- In the Root File Manager app, do the following:
	   - browse to your downloaded image (typically .xz file)
	   - drag the file to the tree IN THE MANAGER on the left side to /etc/osid/imgroot
	   - wait for the copy to complete
	   - STILL IN THE ROOT FILE MANAGER, 
	      - right click on the image in /etc/osid/imgroot and choose Xarchiver option to unarchive the .xz to .img
	   - WAIT... this takes a long time... led at bottom right of Root File Manager window will blink red and green
	   -            	




- Problem is that script expected the user name to be "pi" not "jim" so the desktop setup for the icon fails
- The folder /etc/osid/system has the icon and the run_app.sh script
- Open files icon (top of RPi desktop)
  - browse to /etc/osid/system
  - right click the icon named "rPi SD Card Duplicator" and choose "copy"
  - browse to /home/jim/Desktop
  - paste icon into /home/jim/Desktop folder
  - in terminal window
    - cd /home/jim/Desktop      
    - chmod 755 osid.desktop.sample


    Perhaps the best choice is now to rebuild using pi/pi as username/password; also, select firefox as the browser...
