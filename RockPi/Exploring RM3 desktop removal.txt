Exploring RM3 desktop removal

082523

The build image we used for the RM3_20230824.img was:
   radxa-cm3-io-debian-bullseye-xfce4-arm64-20230317-0810-gpt.img
the title of which seems to imply an xfce4 desktop...

The CB image resulting from the build has a desktop, but no applications along
 the side or an applications menu. A right click of the mouse on the desktop
 shows a pulldown with some applications... some work (ex, dictionary, Ristretto Image Viewer, Firefox, Task Manager, all system tools (xterm, uxterm, file manager), multimedia tools, utilities, settings)   

Trying to execute "obconf" we get an error "obconf... No such file or directory"
  and the dialog banner reads "Openbox"... 

So what is relationship between xfce4 and openbox??
 From what I can tell on the net, Openbox is a window manager used in place of the xfwm (xf window manager (?)) tool. It is installed on top of xfce4

Experiments...
- Start with a fresh copy of the base image (20230317) and boot to login; 
   this gives a debian desktop with menu bar at top and icons on left (Filesystem root; boot; File System; Home) 
     The pulldown menu from top has an About. Opening that gives an option"
      About, which revealt: "Xfce is a collwction of programs that together provice a full featured desktop environment" and then lists the programs that make up the core: xfwm4 (window manager); xfce4-panel (Panel); xfdesktop (Desktop manager); thunar (File manager); thunar-volman (Volume manager); xfce4-session (Session Manager); xfce4-settings (Setting System); xfce4-appfinder (Application Finder); xfconf (Settings Daemon); garcon (Menu Library); tumbler (Thumbnails Service);
- login (rock/rock) and create logon for root (connectbox)
- logout then log back in as root (and we get same desktop)
- which openbox -> /usr/bin/openbox
- ls /usr/share/xsessions shows lightdm-xsession.desktop, openbox.desktop and xfce.desktop...
- 

- Try removing openbox with apt-get remove openbox
("using /usr/bin/xfwm4 to provide /usr/bin/s-window-manager in auto mode")
- succeeds...  do "reboot now"... login as root... same desktop
- try " apt-get remove --auto-remove openbox " to remove support packages (pic taken)... succeeds... reboot... login as root... ok
- try "apt-get purge openbox "... reboot... login... OK
- 

Try removing Xfce4... 
- try "apt-get remove xfce4-* "  (34 packages removed)
- then "apt-get remove xfce4" (no packages to remove... 
   suggests "apt autoremove")
- then "apt autoremove"   (19 packages removed... 12.7 MB space)
- then "apt-get purge xfce4" ("xfce4 not installed so none removed")
- reboot... login root... we have desktop "debian" in blue (normal) but no terminal... try ctl/option F2... we get terminal with full screen...

- try "vi /etc/X11/default-display-manager" and comment out first line reading
   "/usr/sbin/lightdm"

- from https://www.baeldung.com/linux/boot-linux-command-line-mode
   - cat /proc/1/comm (shows "systemd") so we do:
      - systemctl set-default multi-user.target
      - reboot now
      YES!!

SO... I now have what looks like a CLI image for the RM3. Let's do a shring and 
 xz on THAT image and use it as a starting point for an RM3 build...

Save as:
   radxa-cm3-io-debian-bullseye-cli-arm64-20230317.img
   (size of .img was 3.3 GB; size of .xz was 525 MB)

A bit of exploring on the image...
  - to get size of directory use "du -sh <directoryName>"
  - desktop files are generally in /usr/share/applications (212K)
  - /usr/share/X11   (5.9M)
  - /usr/share       (497M)

  So there is some opportunity to remove more "desktop" related stuff, but this
   is a good start. Try a build.


/boot partition issues...
- needs to be 4G but after shrink just 2.7G
- (shrink process touches the source uSD to shrink the partitions before we save the image)

Basic problem... when we do the shrink (as in a CB image) we depend on the PxUSBm code to restore the file size... we need to do something similar for our 
base build image. So how big do we want the image to be? How big is a downloaded image from web?
- Start with an 8GB uSD and burn the Radxa bullseye image
- boot... rock/rock
- sudo passwd root   connectbox
- lsblk shows mmcblk1 7.4G
              mmcblk1p1 512M
              mmcblk1p2 6.9G
   so I think the image is 6.9G
- apt-get remove openbox
-   df -k shows mmcblk1p2     2082392 blocks used   32%
    so the os is closer to 2.3 G (which is close to the shrink size of the CLI image I created)
- apt-get remove --auto-remove openbox
- apt-get purge openbox

- apt-get remove xfce4-* 
- apt autoremove
- cat /proc/1/comm (shows "systemd") so we do:
- systemctl set-default multi-user.target
- reboot now
- df -k showing 31% (2089396 1K blocks used)

- shutdown now

Pull uSD and use dd to create an image with
- cd /home/pi/connectbox
- lsblk		// find /dev/sdb2 is the one of interest
- sudo umount /dev/sdb2
- sudo e2fsck -f /dev/sdb2
- sudo resize2fs /dev/sdb2	-f 1000000	// make it 4GB ??
- USE parted TO MAKE PARTITION SIZE 4.5GB  ??
- sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=Images/radxa-bullseye-cli-031723.img

PROBLEM ISN"T RESIZE... PROBLEM IS PARTED (partition size!)



082723--- Rethink...

Starting with 8GB uSD, we really want to just expand the /dev/sd2 file size
 to be the full size of the partition. Then do a dd to capture the image, then
 an xz to get the image to a reasonable size. Essentially, we want as big a filesize as we can get (ie, all of the partition). When we build a CB image,
 the shrink process will do the parted function to get the partition as small
 as possible so it is a small distribution. When the CB first boots, it will expand the partition to the full size of the uSD and the file size to the full
 size of the partition.

 - resize2fs must be done on unmounted partition
 - lsblk shows attached hardware
 - df -k shows mounted file structure

Summary for creating a CLI version
 - start with 8 GB uSD
 - use Etcher to burn xfce bullseye to the uSD
   (radxa-cm3-io-debian-bullseye-xfce4-arm64-20230317-0810-gpt.img.xz)
 - put uSD in target and boot... rock/rock login; enable root login; 
    login as root
 - remove desktop code:
   - run: apt-get remove --auto-remove openbox
   - run: apt-get purge openbox
   - run: apt-get remove xfce4-*
   - run: apt autoremove
   - run: systemctl set-default multi-user.target
   - run: reboot now
   - (should boot to login prompt, no desktop)
 - run: shutdown now
 - put uSD into RPi-4
 - run: lsblk
 - verify that sdb/sdb2 is the partition to play with
 - run: sudo umount /dev/sdb2    
 - run: sudo e2fsck -f /dev/sdb2
 - run: sudo resize2fs /dev/sdb2
 - (now have expanded file system memory to full size of partition)
 - run: sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=Images/radxa-bullseye-cli-031723.img 
 - (now have full size image of the uSD... about 7.4 GB)
 - run: xz -k Images/radxa-bullseye-cli-031723.img
 - (now have xz version of the cli base image... about 560M)

 - we can now publish the cli version to github as a cli base image

 Build from CLI version base
  - boot in target and login as root
  - run: df -k			// verify that /dev/mmcblk1p2 showing about 32% use
  - normal build process
