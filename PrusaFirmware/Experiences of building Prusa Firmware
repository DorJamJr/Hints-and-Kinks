Experiences of building Prusa Firmware

BUILD:
Install VirtualBox and then install Ubuntu 22 in VB
Create user dorjamjr with pw pepsi4

Download the desired source files and directory from 
   https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/releases  ("Source code (zip)")
 and put it beneath the 
 /Users/Jim/Documents/GitHub directory 
 (like /Users/Jim/Documents/GitHubPrusa_FW_3.14.0)
Under the new directory, create a new folder named "BUILDS"
 (like /Users/Jim/Documents/GitHubPrusa_FW_3.14.0/BUILDS)

In GitHub desktop, add the new release to the repository
  - Click "Current Repository" (upper left)
  - Click "Add" 
  - Click "Create a new repository"
  - Copy name of your added top level folder (like "GitHubPrusa_FW_3.14.0") and 
     paste int "Name"
  - Click "Create Repository"
  - Warning says "directory not a repo... create instead?"
  - Click "create a repository"
  - Click "Publish" (to push up to DorJamJr... in the where dialog, 
     choose other... default then to DorJamJr)



THE CHANGES.....

Mimic the following changes to make the new firmware release compatible with the 
 Craig version of Prusa MK3.5...

THE BUILD.........

In VB Ubuntu, click Settings (gear icon) -> Shared Folders and add your project folder
 (like /Users/Jim/Documents/GitHub/Prusa_FW_3.14.0)
Set a simple name for the folder (like "Prusa") in the Folder Name box 
Click box Auto-mount, then OK, OK
Restart VB (Ubuntu) and now the Ubuntu folders contains sf_Prusa 

In VirtualBox, access to this folder is via folder name "sf_Prusa" (shared folder) and can be 
  used within the Ubuntu environment by terminal folder /media/sf_Prusa

(See article at: 
  https://askubuntu.com/questions/466198/how-do-i-change-the-color-for-directories-with-ls-in-the-console
 for some helpful color changes for the terminal)  

 In Ubuntu, open a terminal window... (Bottom left... choose applications... choose Terminal)

BUILD commands in the Ubuntu terminal:
  cd /media/sf_Prusa
  sudo ./PF-build.sh
    (pw = pepsi4)
    varient = 10 (MK3S)
    option  = 2  (English only)
    (The build starts and completes without further intervention)

Build output located in the Ubuntu environment directory: /media/PF-bulid-hex
 Note that the output files are two levels below this folder, the exact path determined by
  the firmware title (ex: "FW 3140")... find the appropriate folder and drill down. In the 
  specific case of FW3140, the path looks like:
   /media/PF-build-hex/FW3140-Build8066/BOARD_EINSY_1_0a/
  and the resultin files are:
   FW3140-Build8066-MK3S-EN_FARM.elf
   FW3140-Build8066-MK3S-EN_FARM.hex
  Note that this is NOT directly available outside of the VirtualBox environment

After a build, rename the created .hex and .elf to something simple (like 01_MK3S_3140.hex 
 and 01_MK3S_3140.elf):
    sudo FW3140-Build8066-MK3S-EN_FARM.elf 01_MK3A_3140.elf
    sudo FW3140-Build8066-MK3S-EN_FARM.hex 01_MK3A_3140.hex

Copy the .hex file to the /media/sf_Prusa/BUILDS directory (create it first) so that
  the hex will be available to the Prusa slicer for upload to the printer
In Prusa Slicer, go to Configuration -> Flash Printer Firmware and browse to:
  /Users/Jim/Documents/GitHub/Prusa-Firmware/BUILDS. 
Find the .hex file, select it and upload to the printer. 
  (Note: make sure to disconnect Pronterface or the upload will fail.)
After loading new firmware, the printer will try to do a full calibration. Abort it! 
 Then restart and choose to do the calibration manually. (Don't do any calibration though!)
Go to Settings -> Live Z Adjust and set Z to -0.700
Go to Calibration -> Auto home
Go to Calibration and run First Layer Cal -> Continue (DO NOT do RESET)
  Cal will start at -0.700
    Make the number MORE NEGATIVE to move head DOWN
(My new number after 3.14.0 install was -0.803)




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------- Below is the history of debug that resulted in the above recipe -------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Debug:
Not getting through self check
Trying to see debug statements
Use Pronterface with serial connected shows output of:
  	printf_P(PSTR("tmc2130_goto_step %d %d %d %d \n"), axis, step, dir, delay_us, microstep_resolution);
Use this as a model for my own debug...
Also:
      SERIAL_PROTOCOLPGM("?JRA - At gcode_M45 (#3103).\n");
Failing the M45 with "Calibration failed! Check the axes and run again."
Try to find where in code this is occurring...
Marlin_main.cpp
  M45 entry point at #3103
  Getting past

Fails at #3221
   Z_AXIS_POSITION is: 6.685, 6.922, 
   MESH_HOME_Z_SEARCH is: 0
   HOME_Z_SEARCH_THRESHOLD is: 5.0

Create a Prusa bed look alike with fibreboard and aluminum tape with holes at "Calibration points"
Now the Z_AXIS_POSITION comes in at 5.0 (consistent)

So the search for bed cal points is to find the skew of the bed ... it does this by looking for blank spots
 in the heating element of the heatbed. So this is a crucial part of the Prusa design and must be simulated accurately if we are to make it run like a real MK3S.

 The center of the front left cal spot is 49.7 mm from the front of the Ender heat bed
 Dimensions from that point to next cal: horizontal= 119.67+88.8 = 208.47   209
                                         vertical  = 92.18+99.67 = 191.85   192

 11/21/23
 Try to find the point where the code is failing the xy search (skew) numbers and paste in some valid results...
 The fail is at # 3299 (else)
 The "if" is at #3223... but this is just the cal of Z axis (which we have now got sorted... so wherre is the  skew routine fail?)

 #3225 - #3243 - "if only Z"  (we are doing all)
 #3253 doing circular search for hole
 mesh_bed_calibration.cpp #2441 is where the successful result is found/stored

 		bed skew angles stored in a1, a2 (#336, #337)
 		0.12 skew is "mild"

 		BED_SKEW_OFFSET_DETECTION_PERFECT 			= 0,  //!< Perfect.
		BED_SKEW_OFFSET_DETECTION_SKEW_MILD			= 1,  //!< Mildly skewed.
		BED_SKEW_OFFSET_DETECTION_SKEW_EXTREME		= 2   //!< Extremely skewed.

		Note:  NEW_XYZCAL is defined (enabled) for variant MK3s		

		Note: find_bed_offset_and_skew() starts on #2194
		Iteration loop begins at #2216

		Constants for hole locations at #82 ff

		Use Pronterface with command M45 to debug

		Using rev 4 of the xy cal fixture with front edge set at 21.75 from front edge of heater plate, and using rev 12 of the hex OS (X0 = 37, X1 = 227, Y0 = 18.4, Y1 = 210.4) we seem to be calibrating

		Failed....
		Enlarge holes to 10mm (drill) and we get through point 1 

		calculate_machine_skew_and_offset_LS() is where the skew is calulated

11/24/23

Using fixture XYZ_Cal-5 (hole locations X0=37, X1=227, Y0=18.4, Y1=190.4) with Prusa code v 13) I located the X0,Y0 hole at same location as on the MK3.9 bed, then run code M45
Front edges offset 8.56... failed, can't find point #2... scan seems to be from front edge of circle to about 7.5mm past back edge... so change edge/edge position to 12.3mm and retry

Search for X0,Y0 seems about right for Y margins... the X search seems to be about 3mm to the right... but we did get 71.2%,61.3% coorelation (whatever that means), X1,Y0 fails... 

DBG(_n("Pattern center [%f %f], match %f%%\n"), max_c + 5.5f, max_r + 5.5f, max_match / 1.32f);
   7.5, 24.5

   edge/edge 10.76 (about center Y on search area)...  Failed X0,Y0

   edge/edge 11.5   ALL 4 calibration points found, BUT the recheck of locations failed... x position seems to be 6 mm too far right (the 6 mm offset I think) so change the X0, X1 locations in code by -6 to 31 and 221 and build ver 14 of code

   Change JRA_X0 and JRA_X1 to 31.f and 221.f
   This seems to have run and updated the Support-> XYZ.cal details to:
      Y distance from min:   Left: 10.34, Right: 10.30
      Measured skeb: 0.61 degrees (severe skew 0.25, mild skew 0.12)
      [0;0] point offset: X:0.09, Y:-0.16

   So I THINK this means the test bed is working, but it is finding a large skew...

   Adjusted the left rail to shorten by 0.6mm and try m45... failed X1,Y0 

   Move mask forward a bit... try again... failed..,, repeat...
   Bit by bit to e/e of 8.5... mostly fail X0,Y0

   Try bit by bit moveing back...
   @13.13 e/e we got all 4 points but they resulted in:
      Y distance from min:   Left: 10.34, Right: 10.30
      Measured skeb: 1.26 degrees (severe skew 0.25, mild skew 0.12)
      [0;0] point offset: X:0.09, Y:-0.16

      AARGH!

      See: https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/issues/147
      mesh_bed_calibration.cpp #702
      I have disabled skew correction (per above) in ver 16.... let's finish the printer and see if we can print... (The message about needing calibration is still on the opening screen... if everything else is ok, we can mod the code to prevent message popup)

      
 112523
 Attach Ender plate and mag sheet... Wire into Rambo
 Attach latest cal mask to top of mag sheet with blue tape and run m45
 That completes with skew 1.45 (at 150mm this computes to 3.6 mm rotation)
 Rotate cal plate clockwise (1mm?) and re run to see if the 1.45 comes down 

 Left e/e offset = 13.27, right e/e offset = 13.07 ... skew = 0.13 degrees (amazing!) but the Y offset (L and right) still showing the reset values ("nanmm")  and [0;0] point offset showing X and Y "nanmm"

 Check move limits: X=210   (could go to 220); Y=195  (mayby go to 210); Z=195 (ok)

On first layer cal, we hit Crash Detected on X... enable codes M910 - M918 and run "M916 X" which shows X value is 0,  Change to 1... but that seems to be more sensitive... 

ver 20 of hex file... raise x running current from 16 to 22 and homing current from 8 to 12 (try to fix crash) MK3S.h #282
   -- Better... got thru 9 points of cal on first layer calibration... then crashed on homing 
   -- raise currents to 25 and 15 (v21 hex)
   -- raise currents to 30 and 20 (v22 hex)
   -- too much... some x stall (thermal shutdown x?)
   -- 22 & 16 (ver 23 hex)

112623
Decided to change out the X motor. The one on C3 had a 33 mm deep frame, the MK3.9 has a 39 mm frame. Looking at my original printer (Kysan motors... supposedly pretty good motors) the X motor there has a 47mm frame. I THINK this gives more torque per ma, so hoping that will solve the "X crash" issues. While trading out the motor, I found that the pully on the C3 motor was loose! After trading motors (re-use the pully from C3... diameter is smaller) I ran first layer calibration successfully. Then took back the motor currents back to the originals (16 and 8) (ver 24) and again ran first layer cal... successfully. Note that Zoffset = -0.723mm for the successful prints.

Going to try Calibration -> Wizard
  - fails "Axis length   X" (measured axis length 244.210) ?? add debug statement and compile v 25
  - default was set at 220, change to 242 and recompile v25
  - OK to xyz cal... couldn't find #2... (e/e = 13.19)
  - change to 12.19,11.81 (left.right) and retry xyz
     - result: Fail: 0.70   e/e  12.32, 12.03
     - e/e 12.29, 11.69... can't find #2
     - e/e 12.91, 12.30 --- failed 1.84


112723     
Print large square (190mm) and stop after first traces down. From the pattern we find:
  - front margin - back margin is 7.33 mm... need to move the Y plate BACK (so vertical frame FORWARD) by 7.33/2 = 3.15 mm = 2.1 turns
  - the "square" is skewed (use 8.5x11 sheet) by 1.6mm over length of 190mm... to correct this, we need to bring the RIGHT side of the vertical plate BACKWARD by 1.43mm   (thread rod separation = 170mm so 170/190 x 1.6) ==> 1.43/1.5 Turns (.95 T)==> 5.72 faces
- COMBINING:
  Right side plate nuts need to move FORWARD by 3.15mm and then BACK by 1.43/2 (=.71mm) = 2.44mm = 1.62T = 1 Turn + 3.75 faces
  Lefts side plate nuts need to move FORWARD by 3.15 mm and the FORWARD by 1.43/2 (=.71mm) = 3.86 mm = 2.57T = 2 T + 3.44 faces

  Make adjustments and reprint the 190mm square...
  - Y centering now OK
  - still 0.55mm skew on 190mm run...bring RIGHT side nut FORWARD by 170/190*0.55mm = .49mm ... (.49/1.5)*6
    = 0T + 2 faces
  - (TMC OVERTEMP??)

  Make adjustment and reprint again... Got it!


  112823

  With rail attached on right side and cal plate biased into rail and e/e (calPlate front aligned to rail front) we need to offset x cal -8, y cal -6, so try : X0=23, X1=213, Y0=12.4, Y1=184
    WAS:
    - #define JRA_X0 31.f  // was 37.f
      #define JRA_X1 221.f  // was 227.f  // was 245.f
      #define JRA_Y0 18.4f
      #define JRA_Y1 190.4f // was 210.4f

   The offsets to x and y based on auto home followed by finding x/y of first hole where nozzel is in the center... create ver 26, upload and try xyz cal...
   

112923     

Find out where the success constants for xyz cal are stored  (M45 command I think (#3103 <- #5523 <- #3971))
 #3971 - process_commands() contains case M45 which contains "case 45:" (#5523) which calls "gcode_M45()" at #3103

 eeprom.cpp #62 store bed constants
 Marlin_main.cpp - #3258 - find_bed_offset_and_skew(..) -> mesh_bed_calibration.cpp #2211
 #2455 calculate machine skew()
 #188  find_bed_offset_and_skew()   (see #380 where skew is computed)
    at #383 angle diff is what is stored by eeprom_update_float()

 "Y distance from min" - ultralcd.cpp #2446: count_xyz_details(distanceMin) (distanceMin[0] = Left, distanceMin[1] = Right)   but this gets a bit hairy reading an array of points and doing some calcs!

 #2443  lcd_menu_xyz_y_min()  ->  "Left: Right:"
 #2487  lcd_menu_xyz_skew()   ->  "Skew"
 #2522  lcd_menu_xyz_offset() ->  "[0;0] point offset"

 Marlin_main.cpp - #1547 - calibration needed message  - comment out
                 - #1554 - live adjust warning... re-run live adjust -  fixed power on msg on Z-adj
                 - #1557 - thermal model not yet set - run thermal model cal

There is a new version of firmware for the Prusa... 3.14.0
Create a new github (local) folder: /Users/Jim/Documents/GitHub/Prusa_FW_3.14.0
Open GitHub Desktop, repo = "Prusa-Firmware"
  Looking at the History tab, select the "Changes to source for my MK3S clone"
  At the bottom of the list are the Firmware folder changes listing the files I touched to make the 
   MK3S clone (with non-Prusa heat bed) work. Changes are to files Firmware/:
    - Marlin_main.cpp
    - mesh_bed_calibration.cpp
    - mesh_bed_calibration.h
    - ultalcd.cpp
    - variants/MK3S.h

So to create a 3.14.0 version, we should be able to examine the changes to these files (using GitHub desktop, History) and mimic those same changes in the 3.14.0 code version.
