Debug for RPi_051023

First problem is that the PxUSBm.py doesn't create /usr/local/connectbox/expand_progress.txt (caused by failure of fdisk command sequence)
	- #443 - the form 
	     child.expect('Partition number (1,2*') 
	  throws an error because of the unmatched parenthesis (even though it is in a string quote)
	- Changing to form
	      child.expect('Partition number')
	  resolves the problem
	- This only happens on a RPi version (because NEO just has one partition (?))  
	  
Next problem - the expand_progress.txt file contains "running"
