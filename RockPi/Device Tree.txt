Device trees... 

Where are they stored:  /boot/dtbs/($-uname -r)/rockchip
How to read a .dtb file
   apt-get install device-tree-compiler
   dtc -I dtb -O dts <file-tree-name>.dts <file-tree-name>.dtb
   then we can vi the file-tree-name.dts

Which (of the many) dtb files are being used?
  One source says the info is compiled into the kernel
  Another answer (more likely) is that the hardware version is detected during the boot process (/proc/cpuinfo ??) and that info is used to select the correct dtb file

/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf has entries for 
  /boot/vmlinuz... (kernel); 
  /boot/initrd.img... (initrd);
  /boot/dtbs/4.19...   (devicetreedir)
  /boot/dtbs/4.19.../rockchip/overlay/rk3668-fiq-debugger...dtbo;
           rk3568-disable-npu.dtbo   (fdt ovrerlays)

Here is an interesting post on making GPIO7 an output using overlays...
